# Edit Book Details Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented the ability to edit book details from the Book Detail screen. The implementation reuses the existing `BookFormScreen` which was already designed to handle both create and edit operations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Book Detail Screen (`lib/features/book_detail/book_detail_screen.dart`)

#### Added Imports
- `GenreService` and `GoogleBooksService` for providing dependencies to the form screen
- `BookFormScreen` and `AddBookFormViewModel` for navigation and data conversion

#### Modified Edit Button Handler
- **Before**: Showed a placeholder SnackBar message "Edycja - wkrótce dostępna"
- **After**: Calls `_navigateToEditScreen()` method

#### Added `_navigateToEditScreen()` Method
Location: Lines 294-353

This method:
1. Extracts the book data from the current state
2. Converts `BookDetailDto` to `AddBookFormViewModel`
3. Provides necessary service dependencies via `MultiRepositoryProvider`
4. Navigates to `BookFormScreen` with `bookId` and `bookData` parameters
5. Refreshes book details if the edit was successful (result == true)

### 2. Add Book BLoC (`lib/features/add_book/bloc/add_book_bloc.dart`)

#### Enhanced Success Messages
- **Create**: "Książka została dodana"
- **Update**: "Książka została zaktualizowana"

This provides better user feedback by distinguishing between adding and editing operations.

## How It Works

### User Flow
1. User navigates to Book Detail screen
2. User taps the Edit button (pencil icon) in the app bar
3. System navigates to Book Form screen with pre-filled data
4. User modifies book details
5. User taps "Zapisz zmiany" button
6. System updates the book in the database
7. System shows success message: "Książka została zaktualizowana"
8. System returns to Book Detail screen
9. Book Detail screen refreshes to show updated data

### Technical Flow
```
BookDetailScreen
  ↓ (Edit button tapped)
  ↓ Extract book data from state
  ↓ Convert BookDetailDto → AddBookFormViewModel
  ↓
BookFormScreen (with bookId != null)
  ↓ User edits form
  ↓ User saves
  ↓
AddBookBloc.SaveBook event
  ↓ bookId != null → updateBook()
  ↓
BookService.updateBook()
  ↓ Success
  ↓
BookSaved state (message: "Książka została zaktualizowana")
  ↓ Navigator.pop(true)
  ↓
BookDetailScreen refreshes
  ↓
BookDetailsBloc.FetchBookDetails event
```

## Reused Components

The implementation leverages existing, well-tested components:

1. **BookFormScreen**: Already supported edit mode via `bookId` parameter
2. **AddBookBloc**: Already handled both create and update operations
3. **AddBookFormViewModel**: Already had `toUpdateBookDto()` conversion method
4. **BookService**: Already had `updateBook()` method implemented

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Service Dependency Injection
Used `MultiRepositoryProvider` to provide services to `BookFormScreen` since it creates its own `BlocProvider` internally and needs access to `BookService`, `GenreService`, and `GoogleBooksService`.

### 2. Data Conversion
Instead of using `AddBookFormViewModel.fromBook()` factory method, created the view model directly with named parameters. This is more explicit and easier to understand.

### 3. Refresh on Success
When the edit is successful, the book detail screen automatically refreshes by dispatching `FetchBookDetails` event. This ensures the UI shows the latest data without requiring manual refresh.

### 4. Different Success Messages
Modified the BLoC to emit different success messages for create vs update operations, improving user experience.

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Static analysis passes (flutter analyze)
- [x] No linter errors
- [ ] Manual test: Edit book title
- [ ] Manual test: Edit book genre
- [ ] Manual test: Edit optional fields (ISBN, publisher, year)
- [ ] Manual test: Cancel edit (no changes saved)
- [ ] Manual test: Validation errors display correctly
- [ ] Manual test: Success message shows "zaktualizowana"
- [ ] Manual test: Book detail refreshes after edit

## Files Modified

1. `lib/features/book_detail/book_detail_screen.dart` - Added edit navigation
2. `lib/features/add_book/bloc/add_book_bloc.dart` - Enhanced success messages

## Lines of Code Added
- Imports: 4 lines
- Method implementation: ~60 lines
- Success message enhancement: 2 lines
- **Total**: ~66 lines

## Implementation Time
- Actual: ~10 minutes (as predicted)
- Complexity: Trivial (just wiring existing components)
