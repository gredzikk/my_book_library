## Project Description

My Book Library is a Flutter-based mobile application for the Android platform that aims to solve the common problem of managing a diverse collection of physical and digital books. It offers an intuitive platform for cataloging books, monitoring reading progress through sessions, and analyzing reading activity. By integrating with the Google Books API, the app automates the process of adding new books, making library management quick and easy.

### Key Features

-   **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login using Supabase Auth.
-   **Library Management**: Add books manually or by scanning an ISBN, which fetches data from the Google Books API. Edit and delete books from your library.
-   **Progress Tracking**: Assign statuses ("Unread", "In Progress", "Read") to books and track reading progress by starting/stopping reading sessions.
-   **Data Visualization**: View your library in a grid format, filter by status or genre, and review the history of reading sessions for each book.
-   **Onboarding**: A simple tutorial for new users to get acquainted with the app's main features.
-   **Notifications**: Receive push notifications for reading sessions that have been active for an extended period.

## Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: Flutter & Dart
-   **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)**: Supabase
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
-   **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
-   **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
